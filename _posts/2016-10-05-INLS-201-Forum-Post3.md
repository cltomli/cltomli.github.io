<p> <i> (I am using this to sumbit a assigmnt for INLS 201) </i> </p>





<p> Before this semester I had absolutely no experience with coding. I knew it was something that I wanted to try but had never made any real effort to start. However, this semester I have found myself in three classes that require me to code, COMP 110, INLS 201, and now INLS 161. They are all beginner level classes so I am learning many of the same skills and lessons in multiple classes even though each class is working with different types of coding languages. In COMP 110 most everything I am learning is in Java, but for INLS 201 I am leaning to code in HTML. However, despite having had some experience using HTML it has still been very educational to actually learn about HTML instead of simply using a basic understanding of it to write commands.

<p> Like any other form of coding that I have encountered HTML is can be viewed as a type of language. A language that is very particular and strict about the way it is “spoken” in order for it to be understood. I say this because there are very basic but strict guide lines that must be followed when using HTML in order for it to be processed correctly. For example whenever a tag is “opened,” such as < p > when started a paragraph, it must be closed once the paragraph is complete with the tag < /p >.To being with HTML standing for Hyper Text Mark Up Language which is used to create web pages. In order to make a webpage there is a basic HTML format you must follow when creating it. The first thing is to declare what type of document the webpage will be written in, this is done by typing < !DOCTYPE > at the beginning of the page. Then to indicate that the webpage will be written in HTML < html > must be stated below it. That takes care of the procedural and behind the scene elements that must be created and now the actual content can be created. From there the title and the body can then be created. Tags aren’t just used for declaration but also for augmentation of text. To make a certain line of text italicized you simply use the tag < i > followed by the type you wish to italicize and then close the tag. Many of the text editing tools that are commonly used when creating a word document are just as easily done when using HTML. If you wanted to center a block of text all you would need to do is create a style when opening a tag. For example < p style=”text-align:center;” >. After using HTML it is easy to realize that most everything you can do uses the same formatting. This can be seen when creating a text that is hyperlinked. All you do is open a tag with < a  href= ”url” >, then the text you desire to be hyperlinked followed by the closing tag </a>. Just like any other language you can start to recognize patterns and the more you practice the more intuitive it becomes.

<p> CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a language that describes the style of a HTML document. CSS simply makes the customization of web pages take much less time and lets you modify everything in one command. CSS allows you to assign multiple properties and values to the same part of a website. For example, it could look like
 
 
body {


font-family: ‘Josefin Sans’;


color: black;


front-size: 200%; }


<p> I have worked with all of this information before, but I never had the opportunity to really learn about the back group of HTML and CCS. After having the opportunity to do so in this class I feel more comfortable and confident when using them. However, when it comes to databases I had no previous knowledge.

<p> ERM or entity-relationship model is a way to organize data though relationships. It does this by making categories with certain information that relegates to different categories with certain information. It sounds like in large quantities this would become very confusing but really when you look at everything as a whole it is very easy to search for the information you are looking for. The largest category in an ERM is an entity. An entity is the broadest category there is and contains the most information. For example, an entity could be a person, or books, or publishers. Those are all very broad things with no real distinguishing factors or ways to further narrow down the information. That is where attributes come into play. Attributes are more specific information about entities. So for people an attribute would be authors, for the entity books an attribute would be titles, and for the entity publishers and attribute would be names. These things are more specific but are still vague as many things can hold the same attributes and still be indistinguishable from each other. That is where primary keys come into play. Primary keys are things that are unique to one object, such as a social security number, ISBN, or an address. With primary keys you are able to find a very specific object among a sea of other data. The relationships within all of these entities are what make ERMs so useful. They allow us to easily see the connection between information that normally would be hard to find and put together.

<p> I have interacted with these structures every day of my life since I was ten years old. With how fundamental the Internet has become (there are even talks of the internet being a human right) it would actually be difficult for me to go 24 hours without interacting with the structures we have discussed during the past two weeks of class. Despite being around them so much I have never known what went on behind the scenes to create what I used every day. Every webpage that I view, video game that I play, and YouTube video that I watch utilizes HTML and CSS in some way. Now I directly interact with these concepts on a daily basis but I feel ashamed to have been so ignorant of what actually made up the content that I have been consuming for the past 10 years. One of the best ways to understand how essential something is to your life is to imagine a world where it didn’t exist. To do that with markup is almost incomprehensible. Not only is my free time consumed by content that is made up of HTML but also my academic life. Every single class that I am in requires me to use and browse web pages, whether it is just to reach Sakai, read a document for homework, or research a topic, I rely on web pages made from markup language just as much for my education as I do for any other part of my life.

<p> My interaction with databases and relationships are almost just as abundant. The most obvious example is the library but in reality there are a lot of ways that I use databases and use them to find relationships between information. Every time I Google something I am utilizing one of the largest databases in the world. Google uses an algorithm to search its extensive database for possible matches that have a relationship to the keyword or phrase that I searched for. These databases and organization systems work in much the same way as our brains when it comes to storing and connection information. For example, every time I meet someone new I create a new entity, then assign them attributes, their name, where they are from, what they do, then I use that information to draw connections, maybe I know someone that works at the same place they do or went to the same school.

<p> Just like myself before this semester millions of people continue on in their lives oblivious to these structures. Many of them will never learn about them. I would not call this information innately important in the grand scheme of things but I think that if more people realized how essential these structures were to their everyday lives they would be more interested in learning about them. If the general population is anything like I was, then they likely have a very inaccurate understanding of just how fundamental these structures really are. In reality people are perfectly capable of succeeding without understanding how things work. There or plenty of jobs and occupations in the world that require very little understanding of how the world really works around them. However, I believe that understanding these structures is a highly sought after skill in today’s information world and I also believe that interest in these skills are growing more and more with each generation.
