<p>My first year after transferring to UNC has been a journey unlike any I have ever experienced. I went from being an outsider in a foreign setting to a committed UNC student who proudly calls this campus home. The personal development that I experienced as I progressed through my first year has made my first year at UNC the single most unforgettable and rewarding one of my life. </p>
<p>The first few weeks of school challenged me. I was starting over and could not help but feel like I did not belong. That feeling likely would have stuck with me had I not happened upon a quote from beloved student body president Eve Carson. She once said, “it’s us – the student body – who make UNC what it is.” These words made me realize that UNC is not great on its own, but rather it’s the students that make it that way and I needed to do my part. I wanted to become involved on campus and make as many connections as possible. This led me to join Sigma Nu, a social fraternity that gave me access to a vast network of students who were already involved in many different aspects of campus life. As the semester continued, I learned more about what it meant to be a Tar Heel and fell in love with the university even more. </p>
<p>Entering my second semester feeling as though UNC was my home I set my mind on two new goals, to make a difference at UNC and to connect with the transfer student body. I wanted to accomplish my first goal by giving back to the community that had given me so much. I started by joining my fraternity’s philanthropy committee. From there I began regularly attending Habitat for Humanity construction builds as well as helping to organize a fraternity BBQ that raised over $2,000 for Habitat for Humanity this past semester. I also joined the organization Carolina Conscious, a group dedicated to improving our campus. It does this by distributing compostable, disposable cups that serve as a reminder to maintain conscious, ethical behavior in social settings. </p>
<p>My second goal was to become more involved with the transfer community. I did this by obtaining a position on the Tau Sigma transfer honors society executive board as their treasurer. As a member of the executive board I helped organize and conduct all Tau Sigma events, allowing me to meet the vast majority of the transfer student body. In my role I find great fulfillment reaching out to struggling transfer students and providing them with guidance and encouragement. I have been in their position before and I feel compelled to help them find their way.</p>
<p>The effort that I have exerted to get where I am has given me a newfound appreciation for everything that I have achieved. Had everything come easily to me I would not feel so obliged to give back and stay connected to the community that I now call home. </p>
