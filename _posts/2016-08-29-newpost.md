<p>When I joined <a href="https://silshack.github.io/inls161fall2016/">INLS 161</a> I did not know what to expect. All I knew was that the class had something to do with coding. I have no background in coding whatsoever so part of me was nervous that I would be way behind the general skill curve for the class. However, coding has always been something that I wanted to try my hand at. I have many friends that are very proficient in Java so I thought it would be fun to learn what it was all about, how hard could it be anyways? Well, after the first few classes I realized that none of it was intuitive, it is like a completely new language and the only way to learn it was though practice. I found that the pace was very fast for me and I constantly fell behind the pace that Tommy Tester was moving at. Learning how to do everything from the instructions posted on the class website wasn’t too challenging but sometimes there were complications that it couldn’t explain.</p> 

<p>Once I got in the routine of things and developed a basic understanding of how to use Git Hub and Cloud 9 things became easier for me. Committing the basic commands to memory was easy but it took me a little while to wrap my head around what they actually did.  This is mostly referring to working with command line. Pwd, ls, and cd confused me at first because there concepts were very new to me so even though I knew they were used for navigating and showing what is in a directory, I didn’t really understand what a directory was. With practice though my understanding grew and they turned out to be very easy commands to understand.</p>

<p>Once we started to work with websites I got pretty excited, I have always wanted to learn how to construct my own website. It became quickly apparently that I had no idea that so much work went into creating each unique website. Unlike before understanding the code came pretty easily to me and I was actually able to keep up with what we were doing as we did it in class. Using git add –v, git commit –a –m, and git push were very intuitive to me because it made sense that it was necessary to essentially save my work to <a href="https://github.com/cltomli/cltomli.github.io">my repository</a> on Git Hub. As we made more progress with our websites I thought it was very cool how we could embed other websites into our own. I am still a little unsure what exactly Jekyll is and does but I know it is what lets me run my website.</p>

<p>After my website was up and running I enjoyed going though and finding all the different ways I could customize and alter me website. I am still not sure what exactly I want to use my website for yet but I am pretty certain that I am going to continue to use it in the future even after we are done using it in this class.</p>

<p>Despite not having any coding background and really having no idea what I am doing sometimes I am really enjoying INLS 161. I find the lesions about the history of technology and the hands on skills that are being taught to be very interesting and look forward to the rest of the semester. </p>
